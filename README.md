general ideas and issues for the code for raleigh brigade

Ok to put ideas right in here?

1. I'm liking #slack alot and feel it's plenty fine as a communication platform for us. I'm not finding discourse very user friendly. Make sure to download the mobile app for slack. All if CFA is using it. I posted recently and got lots of responses. The #raleigh channel is a good place to share ideas.  Also, no need to 'shut down' the Google Plus community, our strategy should be multi-faceted, just cause no one is using it doesn't mean we should kill it.  Slack platform is growing fast.
2. The inspections dept. at the City of Raleigh is overwhelmed with all of the new development. They have asked for more staffing, but when asked how many inspections they do each day, they couldn't answer. I've been asked to calculate travel time between a list of addresses for properties that need inspections. This will get # of inspections by inspector, travel time to each location, and what type of inspection.  Code use some CFA help to bring it to the next level.  I will create a repo.
3. The City of Raleigh IT dept has built a MVP of a realtime downtown and NCSU area parking app based on real time meter status, paid or vacant etc. I'd rather focus on walking/biking transportation vs. non-car related apps, but this has a lot of buzz.  I will open a repo.
4. I have been able to hit SeeClickFix api and put points on map. Need to create a repo. Dan Howe (ex City of Raleigh assistant City Manager has been hired back as a contractor to gather data in prep for a 311 system - rumour only). SeeClickFix issue routing is currently a *very* manual process and there is a huge backlog, i.e. automated routing of issues to the folks that can fix them is desparately needed.
5. The FreewheelingNC team could use some development help. 
6. I want my health records on my phone. This is a tough one, but there are interesting things going on with some powerful folks (NC Medical Society, NCSU, Eisenhower fellows, Wake County, and some private companies, all local)
7. Indoor positioning system based on your mac address and personal devices detection of AP's. Imagine signing in to HQ automatically upon entering, or seeing where people tend to gather in wifi enabled spaces, or ads based on which aisle you are on in a shopping market. The tech is there, but need to nail down a project. My cousin is prototyping this in Columbia with his brother and Corey White (Code For Raleigh/Durham GIS/Coder) is playing with it.
8. Map of Coastal real estate owned by yankees vs. locals
9. Double EBT value if someone buys produce from a local farm - this is happening in some other cities, heard it on NPR.  If you spend $15 at a local market, they give you an extra $15 in 'tokens' for purchase.
10. TweetMapViewer needs some tweaking, gets tweets by keyword and location, they location part is messed up.  Should be an easy fix. I put it on heroku here: http://gentle-sands-2370.herokuapp.com/
11. I'm working with Derek Minor and James Sauls on an alternate startup map in Raleigh - MVP here - http://stark-ravine-1413.herokuapp.com/represent-map/
12. hmmm...what else...
